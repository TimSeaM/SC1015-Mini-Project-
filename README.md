# SC1015 Mini Project: Life Expectancy
Lab Y127 
## About

In this data science project, we have used the World Health Organization (WHO) dataset on global health indicators to investigate the impact of various factors on life expectancy. The dataset contains a comprehensive collection of health-related indicators from year 2000-2015 for 193 countries, including socio-economic status, demographics, health behaviors, and conditions.

## Problem definition

Our precise problem statement is as follows:

We aim to analyze the WHO dataset to answer two research questions:

Do the initially chosen predicting factors have a significant effect on life expectancy, or do some of these factors have negligible influence?
Which variables are the most important predictors of life expectancy, and how can we identify and prioritize these key determinants?

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that influence life expectancy and use this knowledge to inform targeted and effective policy interventions. The project will also develop a predictive model that estimates an individual's life expectancy based on a chosen set of relevant factors. By identifying the most impactful variables, we can help governments, healthcare organizations, and communities make data-driven decisions to improve population health outcomes and reduce disparities in life expectancy across different regions.
